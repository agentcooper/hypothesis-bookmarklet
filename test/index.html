      Reading is generally an individual activity, done silently, although on
      occasion a person reads out loud for other listeners; or reads aloud for
      one's own use, for better comprehension. Before the reintroduction of
      separated text (spaces between words) in the late Middle Ages, the ability
      to read silently was considered rather remarkable.

      Major predictors of an individual's ability to read both alphabetic and
      non-alphabetic scripts are oral language skills, phonological awareness,
      rapid automatized naming and verbal IQ.

      As a leisure activity, children and adults read because it is enjoyable
      and interesting. In the US, about half of all adults read one or more
      books for pleasure each year. About 5% read more than 50 books per year.
      Americans read more if they: have more education, read fluently and
      easily, are female, live in cities, and have higher socioeconomic status.
      Children become better readers when they know more about the world in
      general, and when they perceive reading as fun rather than another chore
      to be performed.
